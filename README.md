# Hey, Iâ€™m Thabo ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m learning and working my way into the world of **Azure Cloud Administration**.  
Right now, Iâ€™ve got my **AZ-900** and Iâ€™m studying for the **AZ-104**.  

Most of my free time is spent building small cloud projects â€” things like setting up Azure VMs, VNets, and storage â€” and figuring out ways to make them more secure, faster, and cheaper to run.
